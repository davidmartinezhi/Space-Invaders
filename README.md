#Space Invaders

Based on the hands-on-project from the book "Python Crash Course" (Chapter 12)
and Pygame tutorial form youtube "Tech with Tim" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-__8Xw9KTM.

In this version of space-invaders, just as the classic game:

    -The player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.
    -The player can move left, right , top and buttom with the keyboard arrows and shoot bullets with the space bar.
    -When the game begins a fleet of aliens fill the sky and move down the screen.
    -The player shoots and destroys the aliens.
    -If the player shoots all the aliens, he advances a level and the new fleet is faster and more effective than the previous one.
    -If any alien hits the player ship or gets to the ground, the player loses a ship and life.
    -If the player loses 5 ships, the game ends.

Future extra features:

    -Get improved ships, and revert to the old ones when it is destroyed.
    -A narrative.
